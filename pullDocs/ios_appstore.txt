					    *ios-appstore* *iOS-AppStore*

This file documents the particularities of the App Store version of iVim.

See |ios| for details of the specific iOS-related part.


==============================================================================

1. In-App Purchase                              |ios-iap|
2. iVim Pro                                     |ivim-pro|

==============================================================================
1. In-App Purchase				*ios-iap*

For continuous maintenance of iVim on the App Store, some features are now
included into the `support-package` as In-App Purchase items. They need to be
purchased to work properly in iVim.

The currently available items are:

a. Auto restore                                 |ios-auto-restore|
b. Plugins Manager                              |ivim-plugins-manager|
c. iVim Pro                                     |ivim-pro|


IAP conflicts alert ~

Whenever iVim is opened and there is any `IAP-conflict` (i.e. some features in 
the `support-package` are enabled but not purchased yet), it alerts about this
and the user has two options:

1) Disable for Now
this button disables all the conflicted features for the user and dismisses 
the alert. The user can make decisions later and do the purchases via command
|:isupport|.

2) Purchase
this button opens the `support-package-purchases` view directly for the user
to do the purchasing right away.

Support package purchases view ~

The `support-package-purchases` view lists all the currently available items
in the package. Each item shows its title and a brief description on the left,
and one of three possible states on the right:

1) purchased
if one item has been already purchased, it shows a checkmark as its state.

2) available for purchasing
if one item has not been purchased yet and is available, it shows a button
with its price on it as the state. Tapping the button starts the purchasing
process.

Note that the related feature will be enabled automatically after a 
successful purchasing.

3) not available
sometimes an item may not be available due to the system settings or some
other reasons. In this case, its state says "Not available".

Item menu ~

When you tap one item cell, an actions menu concerning the item shows:

1) What is ...
this option takes you to the help entry on the related feature in iVim.

2) purchase information
this option behaves differently depending on the item's purchase state:
a. if it is not purchased yet, it shows the price tag and tapping it to
purchase;
b. if it is already purchased, it shows a grateful message;
c. it warns if it is not available for now.

There are also two buttons on the top bar:

1) Restore
this button tries to restore items already purchased for the current user.
Which is necessary after a new installation of iVim.

2) Done
this button dismisses this purchases view.

Donation ~

Besides the `support-package`, iVim also provides some donation items in the
IAP list. You can purchase them to support the project.

Donation items are consumable, which means each of them can be purchased more
than once. 

There are two items available in the donation group right now:

1) Big Donation                                     *ios-iap-big-donation*
this item provides an option to donate a relatively big amount of money to
iVim each time. After each purchasing, it shows a piece of thanks information 
and how many times you have donated so far as the details label of the cell.

2) Small Donation                                   *ios-iap-small-donation*
this item provides an option to donate a relatively small amount of money to
iVim each time. It also shows the thanks information and donation times after 
each purchasing as Big Donation does.

Note that, because of being consumable, donation items don't show a checkmark
as their purchasing states.

Command :isupport ~

iVim provides one command to open the `support-package-purchases` view at any
time.

:isu[pport]                                         *:isu* *:isupport*
                It presents the `support-package-purchases` view for the user
                to manage the purchases.


==============================================================================
2. iVim Pro                                         *ivim-pro*

Since version 2.40, iVim adds an IAP subscription option, named "iVim Pro".

From then on, all new premium features will be added into this IAP package.
Without the need to purchase them one by one, you can enjoy them all once you
subscribe to it.

`iVim Pro` is auto-renewable. Which means that it automatically renews the 
subscription whenever a previous one expires, till you cancel it manually.

Note that, the features before `iVim Pro` are still available in the way as it
has been.

Included features ~

So far, `iVim Pro` contains the following features:

a. Version Control (since 2.40)                     |ivim-version-control|
b. Some Spotlight Searching Features                *ivim-pro-spotlight*

    .individual index type toggling         *ios-spotlight-individual-toggle*
    
    With this feature enabled, you can enable or disable a specific index
    type, such as help |ios-spotlight-type-help|; otherwise, you can only
    toggle the whole Spotlight searching completely.

c. Quick Commands Widget                    |ios-widget-quick-commands|
d. Customized Home Screen Quick Actions     |ios-quick-action-customization|
