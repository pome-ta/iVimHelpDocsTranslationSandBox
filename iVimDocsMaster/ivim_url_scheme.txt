==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                 *ivim-url-scheme-intro*

One of iVim's foremost goals is to contribute its editing power to the whole 
iOS system. Examples for this effort include the supports to edit external
files in place, to share files to other apps, and Shortcuts intents for users
to integrate into their own workflows (|ivim-shortcuts|).

Since version 2.41, iVim adds custom URL scheme support.

Simply put, a custom URL scheme is a unique scheme that iVim registers in the
system. When another app opens a URL with this scheme, the system launches
iVim and passes the URL to it. iVim parses this URL, tries to find necessary 
information from it, and acts according to the info found. In other words, you
request iVim by putting your directives into a URL and simply opening it.


==============================================================================
2. Security                                     *ivim-url-scheme-security*

URL schemes offer a potential attack vector into the app. For the sake of 
security, iVim has the following design for its custom URL scheme.

First alert ~

When its URL scheme is invoked the first time, iVim alerts you to the potential
security problem and lets you decide whether to allow or disallow URL schemes.

This alert only shows once. After that, you can change the setting in the
Settings.app (|ios-settings|).

Toggle switch ~

iVim also provides a switch in the Settings.app for you to toggle the custom
URL schemes at any time.

When custom URL scheme is disabled, iVim does nothing after launched by a URL.

3. Usage                                        *ivim-url-scheme-usage*

Format ~

The general format of iVim's custom URL is as following: >

        ivimeditor:<command>[?arg1=value1[&arg2=value2][&...]]
<
The beginning "ivimeditor:" part is the scheme iVim registers in the system.
The system opens iVim whenever it sees this scheme. The <command> is the 
command that is defined and provided by iVim, telling iVim what to do. After
the command, you provide argument pairs, telling iVim how to do it.

Sometimes this format would not be recognized as valid URLs. If this happens,
use the traditional format instead: >

        ivimeditor:///<command>[?arg1=value1[&arg2=value2][&...]]
<

Variable ~
                            *ivim-url-scheme-var* *g:ivim_last_url_scheme*
iVim provides a global variable "g:ivim_last_url_scheme" to record the info of 
the last URL scheme it ran.

It is a dictionary containing entries:

- "scheme_command": the command ran.
- "source_app": the bundle identifier of the source app that invoked this URL.
                it may be unavailable.
- other entries are command-dependent.

It may be undefined if no custom URL scheme has been invoked yet.

Note that it only records info for the last successful custom URL running,
meaning earlier records are overwritten. New app launch makes it undefined.

Commands ~
                                                *ivim-url-scheme-cmds*
So far, iVim defines and offers the following URL scheme commands:

* runexcmd (since 2.41)                         *ivim-url-scheme-runexcmd*
                It asks iVim to run an Ex command.

                The following arguments are available:
                    excmd: 
                        the Ex command to run, this is required. Since only
                        one command is ran for each URL, other Ex commands
                        after the first one are ignored.
                    arg:
                        arguments for the Ex command. Multiple values are
                        allowed and will be appended to *excmd* in order.
                        This is optional since *excmd* can include all its
                        arguments already. 
                    callback:
                        another URL that will be invoked when the Ex command
                        is done. It supports the variable tokens as in cmd
                        |:iopenurl| to provide info in the URL.
                        
                The following entries will be recorded into the global var
                "ivim_last_url_scheme" afterwards:
                    "excmd":
                        the final Ex command line that ran.
                    "output":
                        the output of the Ex command.
                    "callback":
                        the original callback line if any. 

                For example, this runs the command ":iexdir": >

                    ivimeditor:runexcmd?excmd=iexdir
<
                This runs the command ":version": >

                    ivimeditor:runexcmd?excmd=version&excmd=idoc
<
                the second command "idoc" is ignored because only one cmd
                is ran for each URL.

                This runs the command ':echo "hello"': >

                    ivimeditor:runexcmd?excmd=echo%20%22hello%22
<
                the space and double quotes are properly percent escaped,
                otherwise iVim would get an invalid URL.

                This runs the command ":ibrowse -n -w": >

                    ivimeditor:runexcmd?excmd=ibrowse&arg=-n&arg=-w
<
                by distributing args to the *arg* arguments, space escapings
                are evaded.

                This runs the command ':echo "hello"' and passes the output
                to another app via the callback: >

                    ivimeditor:runexcmd?excmd=echo&arg=%22hello%22&callback=
                        s:x?o=%7Bg%3Aivim_last_url_scheme%5B%22output%22%5D%7D
<
                the value of *callback* before escaped was: >

                    s:x?o={g:ivim_last_url_scheme["output"]}
<
                before invoking this URL scheme, iVim evaluates the token
                "{g:ivim_last_url_scheme["output"]}" (the output of Ex cmd) and
                replaces it with the value. As a result, the output is passed
                to the target app.
